--------------------------------PROGRAM DESCRIPTION---------------------------------
LookUpForJustice is an automated Mass State and Federal Congressional Senator Information Look-up 
program to assist in updating information about constituents in a database. Currently it is 
only useful for the state of Nebraska during the years 2012-2014. LookUpForJustice takes a given csv 
file in the format of: "Database ID, Latitude, Longitude", uses Mobile Commons'
look-up tool to find the districts the resident resides in, and matches the district with the 
correct senator's information. This is then outputed to another csv 
file entitled: "filenameCOMPLETED_month-day-year_hourminute.csv" This File will be in the format of:
"Database ID,Latitude,Longitude,Fed_District,Fed_Senator,State_District,State_Senator,SS_Phone,SS_Email"
This new file should be easily imported into your database. 

--------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS----------------------------------------
Make sure you are connected to the internet.
From the main window:
1) Enter the desired file path into the text box either by typing or using the "Browse..."
	button. Reminder: This NEEDS to be a file PATH not just the name.
2) Select the "Run" button to start the program.
3) Another window will pop-up while the program is working. Please be patient as this takes some
	time to run. 100 entries will usually take a minute.
4) After the program has finished running, a pop-up will show the results of the program, 
	(i.e. How many total entries, total out of state (Unwritten) entries, total written entries)
	And your file will have been written!
HELP) If you encounter any error messages, check your internet connection and file format to 
	make sure they are both working.
